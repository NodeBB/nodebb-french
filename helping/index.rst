Helping out the NodeBB Project
==============================

NodeBB is an open source project, and will forever remain free. Here's a number of ways you can help us, even if you aren't a programmer.

* `Like and share our content on Facebook <http://www.facebook.com/NodeBB>`_
* `Follow us on Twitter <http://www.twitter.com/NodeBB>`_ and perhaps tweet **#NodeBB is most awesome forum software @NodeBB** 
* Update our wiki! ;) We need everything from development/design tutorials to user friendly how-to guides.
* Tell everybody about NodeBB, including your grandma and her cats.
* `Submit a pull request, or two, or three.. <http://www.github.com/NodeBB/NodeBB>`_
* Build a new theme
* Write a plugin
* Keep the link back to us on the footer of your own NodeBB :)
* Blog about us! Give the gift of SEO juice this Christmas
* `Help Translate NodeBB <https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/nodebb/>`_ - It's a really simple translation tool and you don't need to know how to code.
* Join our `community <http://community.nodebb.org>`_ and give us a hard time about bugs and missing features


Translating NodeBB to another language
------------------------------------

NodeBB uses Transifex, which is a user friendly visual tool which allows any individual to translate text into a language of their choice. You don't need to be a programmer to do this, so what are you waiting for? `Join the translation team <https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/nodebb/>`_ now :)


Writing Documentation
---------------------

These docs were written using `Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org/>`_ and published using `rtfd.org <http://readthedocs.org/>`_. 

You can edit these docs `directly on GitHub <https://github.com/NodeBB/NodeBB/tree/master/docs>`_, or by clicking on "View page source" on the top right of any page.

If you wish, you can clone the repository and compile the documentation yourself. Check out the `Getting Started <https://read-the-docs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/getting_started.html>`_ section for more info on how to accomplish the latter.

Documentation are auto-compiled and pushed to rtfd.org after every commit.
